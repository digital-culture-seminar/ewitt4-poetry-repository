I speak the names and imagine the lives of all those who where enslaved and forgotten.
May they live in my thoughts and be reinvigorated through my voice.

I am the only One, who proceedeth from an only One who dwelleth in my body.

In the morningboat,
You travel the sky in peace.
All your enemies

As RA everyday,
Alive and stable as my 
Lord RA, true of voice

Stars worship you, your
Beauty in my eyes, your light
Unfurling on my brow.

Unfurling on my
Breast. You go, you rest in the 
Horizon of the west.
